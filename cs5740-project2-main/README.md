# Project 2 Guidance

I suggest the following approach to completing this set of exercises:

- Run the example tfidf_example python script to get a sense of what the tfidf function does and how it works.

- Using an aitools-chat conversation, complete the supervised learning exercise in supervised.py

  - Follow instructions in the project description as to the assessable materials to create.

- Using an aitools-chat conversation, complete the supervised learning exercise in unsupervised.py

  - Follow instructions in the project description as to the assessable materials to create.
  - Don't forget to complete your theory about how the clustering was formed inside unsupervised.py
